What is your emergency?\n\n[00:03] Caller (Voice, English, slightly panicked, Norwegian accent): Yes, hello! I think there's been a bad accident here on Liljeveien. Two cars. One looks really, really badâ¦ wrecked.\n\n[00:07] Dispatch: Liljeveien, confirmed. What type of accident? Are there any injuries? Can you be more specific about the location on Liljeveien?\n\n[00:11] Caller: Car accident, yes.  The one carâ¦ it's like, really smashed up. I can see someone inside, in the driver's seat, and they're not moving. The other car, it looks okay, justâ¦ parked weirdly in the street, I think. I don't know if they are involved, maybe they stopped to help?\n\n[00:19] Dispatch: Okay, stay calm. Liljeveien, can you give me a house number or landmark? And can you check if the person in the damaged car is breathing? Ambulance and police are being dispatched now. Fire department will be alerted if necessary.\n\n[00:25] Caller: Uhmâ¦ it's right by number 12, I think.  The blue house.  Iâ¦ I'm getting closer to the car now.

(Sound of air being injected into tube cuff) Cuff inflated and holding pressure.\n\n[07:00] Paramedic 1:  Pre-oxygenate with BVM for 30 seconds.  (Sound of BVM ventilation) Okay, suction available.  Visualize cords.  (Sound of laryngoscope insertion and manipulation, brief silence, then sound of tube insertion) Tube inserted.  Stylet removed.  Inflate cuff.  (Sound of air being injected into tube cuff again)  Confirm tube placement.  Auscultate bilateral lung sounds and epigastrium.\n\n[07:15] Paramedic 2:  Auscultatingâ¦  Bilateral lung sounds present and equal.  No epigastric sounds.  Good chest rise with ventilation.  Tube depth at 22 cm at the teeth.  Secure tube with commercial holder.  (Sound of securing the endotracheal tube)  Tube secured.  Attaching to mechanical ventilator.  Setting initial settings - rate 10, tidal volume 500ml, FiO2 100%.\n\n[07:35] Paramedic 1:  Mechanical ventilation initiated.  Continue CPR without interruptions for ventilation.  Re-assess rhythm in another two minutes.  Let's think differential diagnosis.  Possible causes of cardiac arrest in this scenarioâ¦  Likely cardiac event, given the circumstances of the accident.  Possible myocardial infarction leading to sudden cardiac arrest and then the collision.  No obvious signs of trauma to suggest traumatic arrest, but we can't rule it out completely until further assessment at the hospital.\n\n[07:55] Paramedic 2:  Agreed.  Age, presentation, sudden onsetâ¦  Cardiac event is high on the differential.  But we need to consider the âHs and Ts' - Hypovolemia, Hypoxia, Hydrogen ions (acidosis), Hypo/hyperkalemia, Hypothermia, Toxins, Tamponade, Tension pneumothorax, Thrombosis (coronary or pulmonary), Trauma.  We've addressed hypoxia with ventilation.  No obvious signs of hypovolemia.  Trauma seems less likely as primary cause, but we need to keep it in mind.  Toxins, less likely in this acute presentation.  Thromboembolic eventâ¦  possible.  Cardiac tamponade or tension pneumothoraxâ¦ unlikely without significant trauma.\n\n[08:25] Paramedic 1:  Good systematic approach.  Let's focus on reversible causes while continuing resuscitation efforts.  Second dose of epinephrine due in a few minutes.  Prepare epinephrine 1mg again.  And let's run a 12-lead EKG as soon as we can get a stable rhythm reading, even if it's still asystole, to look for any ST elevations or other clues.\n\n[08:40] Paramedic 2:  Preparing second dose of epinephrine.  12-lead EKG pads are ready.  Timer is almost up for rhythm re-check.  (Timer beeps)  Rhythm checkâ¦  Still asystole.\n\n[08:48] Paramedic 1:  Administer second dose of epinephrine 1mg IV push.  Flush with saline.  Continue CPR.  And let's get that 12-lead EKG now, even with asystole.  Just to have it for the hospital.  Attach 12-lead pads.\n\n[09:00] Paramedic 2:  Epinephrine pushed and flushed.  12-lead EKG pads attached.  Starting 12-lead acquisitionâ¦  (Sound of EKG machine humming briefly, then printing)  12-lead complete.  Rhythm showing asystole, as expected.  Will label and document time of EKG.\n\n[09:15] Paramedic 1:  Good.  Document everything meticulously.  Time of interventions, medications, rhythm checks, EKG.  Hospital will need a full report.  How's our ETA to Haukeland?\n\n[09:22] Paramedic 2 (Checking GPS/radio):  Dispatch is estimating 8 minutes to hospital arrival based on current traffic.  Physician car still en route, ETA unknown but likely delayed due to traffic and distance.\n\n[09:30] Paramedic 1:  Okay, 8 minutes.  Let's maximize our efforts during transport.  Continue high-quality CPR.  Consider fluid bolus, 500ml normal saline, to address potential hypovolemia, even if not obvious.  And prepare for possible refractory cardiac arrest.  We may need to consider advanced interventions at the hospital if we don't achieve ROSC (Return of Spontaneous Circulation) en route.\n\n[09:45] Paramedic 2:  Fluid bolus of 500ml normal saline prepared.  Ready to administer.  Administering now via IV push.  Fluid bolus complete.  Continuing CPR.  Ventilation maintained via mechanical ventilator.\n\n[10:00] Paramedic 1:  Good.  Re-assess rhythm in another two minutes.  And check for any signs of ROSC, even transiently.  Look for any gasping, eye movement, any signs of spontaneous breathing or pulse.  Although with asystole, ROSC is less likely at this point without further interventions.\n\n[10:10] Paramedic 2:  Two minutes are up.  Rhythm checkâ¦  Still asystole.  No change.  No signs of ROSC.  Still pulseless and apneic.\n\n[10:18] Paramedic 1:  Okay, continue CPR and mechanical ventilation.  No ROSC yet.  Prepare for third dose of epinephrine.  And let's contact Haukeland Hospital directly.  Radio to Bergen Central and request direct medical control patch to Haukeland Emergency Department physician. We need to discuss further management options en route, given the prolonged arrest and lack of response to initial interventions.\n\n[10:30] Paramedic 2 (Radio):  Ambulance 1 to Bergen Central Dispatch.  Requesting medical control patch to Haukeland University Hospital Emergency Department physician for consult regarding critical cardiac arrest patient en route.\n\n[10:35] Dispatch (Radio):  Received Ambulance 1.  Patching you through to Haukeland Emergency Department now.  Stand by for connection.  (Sound of radio static and brief ringing tone, then a new voice)\n\n[10:40] Hospital Physician (Radio, female voice, English, clear and authoritative, hospital background noise): Haukeland Emergency Department physician, Dr. Hansen, speaking.  Ambulance 1, go ahead with your report.\n\n[10:45] Paramedic 1 (Radio):  Dr. Hansen, this is Paramedic 1 from Ambulance 1.  We are en route to Haukeland with a 60-year-old male patient in cardiac arrest following a motor vehicle accident.  Suspect cardiac etiology as primary cause, possibly myocardial infarction leading to arrest and accident.  Patient found pulseless and apneic at scene, initial rhythm asystole.  CPR initiated immediately, mechanical ventilation established, intubated, two doses of epinephrine 1mg IV administered, 500ml normal saline bolus given.  Currently still in asystole, no ROSC achieved.  ETA to hospital approximately 6 minutes.  Requesting guidance on further management en route.\n\n[11:05] Hospital Physician (Radio):  Received Ambulance 1.  Patient 60-year-old male, prolonged cardiac arrest, asystole, no ROSC despite epinephrine and fluids.  Given the prolonged downtime and lack of response, prognosis is guarded.  Continue high-quality CPR and ventilation.  Administer third dose of epinephrine 1mg now.  Upon arrival at hospital, we will be prepared to initiate advanced cardiac life support protocols in the resuscitation room.  Consider potential for underlying reversible causes, but in asystole refractory to initial epinephrine doses, consider termination of resuscitation efforts if no ROSC achieved upon arrival, in consultation with ED team.  Do you have any questions?\n\n[11:30] Paramedic 1 (Radio):  Understood Dr. Hansen.  Administering third dose of epinephrine now.  Will continue CPR and ventilation en route.  We will prepare for possible termination of resuscitation upon arrival if no ROSC.  No further questions at this time.  Ambulance 1, out.  (To Paramedic 2)  Administer third dose of epinephrine 1mg.\n\n[11:40] Paramedic 2:  Third dose of epinephrine 1mg IV push administered.  Flushing with saline.  Continuing CPR.  ETA to hospital is approximately 5 minutes now, according to dispatch.\n\n**[11:52] Paramedic 2: Rhythm checkâ¦ Waitâ¦ hold onâ¦  (Sound of monitor beeping with a more regular rhythm now, not flatline) We have a rhythm change!

ROSC achieved, noted. Continue transport code 3. Hospital advised of change in patient condition.**\n\n[12:20] Paramedic 1: Okay, ROSC achieved, but he is still extremely unstable. We need to get him to definitive care ASAP.  Continue monitoring, document everything.\n\n[12:30] Paramedic 2:  Vitals stable for now, but very tenuous. BP 84/47, HR 130, SpO2 91%.  Still critical.\n\n[12:38] Dispatch (Radio): Ambulance 1, Dispatch.  Hospital is standing by for your arrival.\n\n[12:45] (Sounds of ambulance sirens becoming louder, then slowing down, brakes engaging, ambulance coming to a stop)\n\n[12:50] Paramedic 1: We've arrived at Haukeland Hospital Emergency Department.
